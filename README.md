* The main colors that are used are 

#### Typography
* The Encode Sans SC and Roboto fonts are used thorughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the chosen fonts aren't being imported correctly to the site. Both Encode Sans SC and Roboto fonts are clear and well structured so they are suited to the genre of the site.

#### Imagery 
* The images used are relevent to teh sites purpouse and are intended to attract the users attention. The hero image responds to adjusted screen sizes and reveals more of the image. The reasons section image has been made circular for smaller screens and extends to an oval shape on larger screens revealing more image content. 

### Wireframes 
* When designing and planning content positioning for the website I used wireframe to plot the layout for all the pages on mobile first and being responsive on bigger screens.     

The following displays the different interfaces on Home, Gallery and Contact pages for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

* Mobile screens from 280px
